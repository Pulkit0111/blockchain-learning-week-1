# Blockchain Summary

## _1. Concepts of Blockchain_

- **Define blockchain technology**
Blockchain Technology is the heart of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, We can see it as a distributed ledger technology as it is decentralised in nature which means there is no centralised authority that governs it. It is a decentralised and secured way to record and keep transactions across a network of computers. This uses a consensus mechanismism, to validate the transactions and form a block that can be added to the blockchain. Thid involves sending a transaction request to the P2P network which then validates the transaction by solving a complex mathematical problem that can only be solved by a computer as it involves cryptography, which is called mining and in technical terms we call it as Proof-of-work (PoW), although this consensus mechanism is old now, as of now PoS (Proof-of-stake) is being used as a consensus mechanism.

- **Explain how it differs from traditional databases?**
Blockchain is different from traditional databases in certain key ways, some of which I have listed down below:
    - **Decentralization**
    Blockchain is decentralised and is not governed by any centralised or single authority, In this a network of computer takes part and each computer is termed as node, where as in a traditional database authority is centralized and generally a single entity governs it that makes is vulnerable to single point failure.

    - **Transparency**
    In case of blockchain the transactions are transparent are viewable by everyone in the network, this helps in bulding a trust and also helps in auditing. Whereas in a tranditional database there is generally going to be a single owner from whom you have to request access which is limited to certain users.

    - **Security**
    Blockchain uses cryptography and also consensus mechanism to keep the transactions or data safe but in case of traditional databases, how secure the data is entirely dependent upon the access controls, in this case data is vulnerable to hacking as well.

    - **Immutability** 
    Blockchains are immutable in nature that means once a block has been added to the blockchain that cannot be changed or tampered. Whereas in case of traditional databases if anyone has the acces to edit the databases that can be easily done.

- **Describe its structure and how blocks are added to the blockchain**
In order to understand how does a block is added to the block chain, let's take an example of public blockchain _Bitcoin_.

    - If someone wants to send some bitcoins, that means that particular user is requesting a transaction.
    - This request goes to a P2P computer network for validation, each computer is called a node here. 
    - This network adds the request to a queue of ongoing transaction validation. 
    - These computers (nodes) in the network work together to validate the transaction by solving a complex mathematical problem and come up with a hash (64 digit Hexadecimal number)
    - Once all the transactions are validated a small fee (in bitcoin) for each transaction that has been validated will be rewarded to the validators (miners).
    - After the validation of these transactions a new block is created and unique ID is going to be generated for it using cryptography.
    - This ID will be generated by putting the previous blockâ€™s ID and information into a formula.
    - Then this block is added to an ongoing chain of blocks, called a blockchain. 

## _2. Working of Blockchain_

- **Describe the process of transaction creation, verification, and block addition to the chain**
The process of transaction creation, verification/validation and block addition may vary depending on the specific blockchain, but following are the general steps involved:
    
    - The process begins with a user or entity initiating a transaction. This could be a transfer of cryptocurrency, the execution of a smart contract, or some other interaction with the blockchain.
    - The user must sign the transaction using their private key. This digital signature is generated through a cryptographic process and is unique to the user's private key. It serves as proof that the transaction was initiated by the owner of the private key.
    - The transaction data, including the digital signature, is hashed to create a unique transaction hash. This hash is used to identify the transaction and is included in the transaction data.
    - The user's client software or wallet broadcasts the transaction to the blockchain network. This involves sending the transaction data, including the transaction hash and the digital signature, to nodes in the network.
    - Nodes on the blockchain network receive the transaction and perform initial checks to ensure it is properly formatted and that the digital signature is valid. Nodes also verify that the sender has sufficient funds to complete the transaction and that the transaction adheres to the blockchain's rules and consensus mechanism.
    - Valid transactions are temporarily stored in a "mempool" (short for memory pool) on each node. The mempool is a waiting area for pending transactions.
    - The blockchain's consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), is used to collectively agree on the validity of pending transactions. Miners (in PoW systems) or validators (in PoS systems) compete to include transactions in the next block.
    - Once a miner or validator successfully adds a block to the blockchain, it includes a set of transactions from the mempool, including the user's transaction. This block is then linked to the previous block in the blockchain, and the transactions within it become a permanent part of the ledger.
    - The user is typically notified of the successful transaction and its confirmation. This notification may occur through the user's wallet or client software.

- **Explain the role of miners in the blockchain**
Once the transaction has been requested and then the next step in the process is to broadcast it to a P2P network of nodes for validation, the validation includes solving a complex mathematical problem in order to validate the transaction, this process is called mining and those who are involved in the process are called miners, so in simple words miners are those who are involved in doing some work in order to validate the transaction and in return they recieve rewards.

- **Discuss the concept of consensus and how it is achieved in a blockchain network**
In order to understand this, let's go back to the basic meaning of word _consensus_, if we look at the the general meaning of it which turns out to be _"a general agreement"_. Now we can deduce a lot of things just by going through this meaning, as we know that blockchain is decentralized which means a single entity is not governing it, so there should be a general agreement while validating a transaction. In order to achieve consensus in a blockchain network since multiple nodes are working together for validation, there are following mechanism behind it.

    - **PoW (proof-of-work)**
    **PoW** is the technical name for **mining**, which involves validating transaction through a computer network in which all the computers (nodes) are working together to solve complex mathematical problems that a computer can only solve as these problems use cryptographic algorithms. On validating these transactions a new block is created which is then added to the blockchain and a reward is provided to the miners. For validating transactions and adding a new block to the blockchain, it takes around **10 minutes**, but it can take a bit more as well if the network is congested, still it is way better than the days long wait for wiring money across the globe.
    Now there are two big **problems** with PoW:

        - It uses a lot of electricity.
        - It can only process a limited number of transactions simultaneously **(7 in case of bitcoin)**.
    
    - **PoS (proof-of-stake)**
    **PoS** also uses cryptographic algorithms for validations, now the transactions are being validated by a chosen validator. A Validator is chosen on the basis of how many coins they hold, known as their **stake**. Technically blocks are not mined here, hence there is no block reward. Blocks a are **forged,** and those who are participating in this process are called **forgers,** they will lock in a certain number of coins on the network and then the one with highest stake is going to be selected as a **validator (forger).** Now, to make sure every time the one with highest number of coins is not being selected as a forger, there are some methods in place:

        - **Randomised Block Selection:** Here a **forger** is being selected on the basis of highest stake and lowest hash value.
        - **Coin age Selection:** This involves selecting a **forger** on the basis of how long they have locked in their coins or we can say held their coins.

## _3. Key Components_

- **Define and explain the role of the following components in a blockchain**
    - **Block**
    A blockchain is composed of a series of blocks. Each block contains a batch of transactions. These transactions can represent various types of data, depending on the blockchain's purpose.
    - **Chain**
    The blocks in a blockchain are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. Each block references the previous block through a unique identifier called a "hash." This chaining ensures the integrity and immutability of the entire blockchain.
    - **Miner**
    Once the transaction has been requested and then the next step in the process is to broadcast it to a P2P network of nodes for validation, the validation includes solving a complex mathematical problem in order to validate the transaction, this process is called mining and those who are involved in the process are called miners, so in simple words miners are those who are involved in doing some work in order to validate the transaction and in return they recieve rewards.

- **Discuss the significance of cryptographic hash functions in linking blocks**
Cryptographic hash functions are like locks for data in a blockchain. They take information from one block and turn it into a unique code. This code is then used as a lock for the next block. If anyone tries to change the information in a block, the lock won't fit, and people will know something's wrong. This way, all the blocks are connected in order, and it's very hard for anyone to cheat. The lock is quick to put on, and we can always check it to make sure everything's secure. It's like a super important tool that keeps the blockchain safe and trustworthy.

## _4. Cryptocurrency_

- **Define cryptocurrency and explain how it relates to blockchain**
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital money, akin to physical currency but existing only in electronic form. It's connected to blockchain technology, a secure digital ledger that records cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain ensures the security and transparency of these transactions. When someone sends or receives cryptocurrency, that action is recorded as a unique entry in the blockchain, with details of the sender, recipient, and amount. This unchangeable record builds trust in the digital money system, as everyone can see and verify these transactions. In essence, cryptocurrency relies on blockchain as its underlying technology to enable secure, decentralized, and transparent transactions in the digital world.

- **Discuss how cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to ensure security, transparency, and decentralization**
Cryptocurrencies use blockchain to stay secure, transparent, and decentralized. Blockchain acts like a digital ledger, recording every transaction in a secure and unchangeable way. It's shared across many computers, so no single person can control it. This decentralization prevents fraud and makes it trustworthy. Plus, all transactions are visible to everyone, boosting transparency. Cryptography ensures that only the rightful owners can access their digital coins, enhancing security. Overall, blockchain technology ensures that cryptocurrencies are reliable, difficult to manipulate, and available for anyone to use without relying on a central authority.

- **Briefly describe the concept of wallets, public/private keys, and addresses in the context of cryptocurrency transactions**
In the world of cryptocurrencies, wallets are like digital pockets that help you manage and store your digital money. They aren't physical, they're digital software or apps. Inside your wallet, you have two important things: public and private keys. Think of your public key as your wallet's address. It's a long string of letters and numbers. You can share this address with others so they can send you cryptocurrency. It's like giving out your email address to receive messages. On the other hand, your private key is like the secret key to your wallet. It's a unique, confidential code that should be kept secure, just like a secret password. With your private key, you can access and control your cryptocurrency. It's important never to share your private key with anyone, just like you wouldn't share your bank PIN. When someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they use your wallet's public key (your address). Your private key is used to confirm and complete the transaction on your end. This way, the blockchain ensures the security and privacy of your digital funds, and only you have control over your money. Your wallet helps you manage and safeguard these keys, making it essential for secure cryptocurrency transactions.
